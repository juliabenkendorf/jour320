<h2> Background </h2>
<p> I was born in Chicago, IL in 2003. I am an only child, but I have a very large extended family and over 30 first cousins. When I was younger, I played a lot of sports, like swimming, water polo, basketball, and track and field. I also love music and taught myself how to play instruments throughout my childhood.  </p>

On campus, I am on the club swim team and write for a few publications. When I'm not in school, you can find me at Lighthouse Beach, watching movies with my roommates, exploring Chicago or trying my best (and often failing) at cooking new recipes.</p>
